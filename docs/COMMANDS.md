## Message-based Interaction: `on_message`

The bot also listens for direct messages in this form to forward prompts to existing agents:

```
@Bot to <spawn_id>: <prompt>
```

Here, `@Bot` is a mention of the bot (e.g. `<@123456789012345678>`), `<spawn_id>` is the agent's ID, and `<prompt>` is the message to pass.

The reason for this design decision is that it allows the user to write a normal message, potentially with code blocks or file attachments,
without the restrictions of slash commands and the inconvenience of writing long messages in slash command text fields getting in their way.
Additionally, it makes it much easier to quickly scan chats, because you can see what you wrote without clicking on the slash command message.

**Example:**
```
<@123456789012345678> to dev: Please refactor the authentication module.
```

The handler ignores messages from other bots or from users not on the allow-list, matches the syntax, validates the `spawn_id`, and then forwards the prompt to the corresponding agent (or reports an error if the spawn ID is unknown).
