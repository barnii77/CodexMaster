Create a discord bot. This is supposed to be self hosted and access restricted (you have to whitelist users in `.env`). As you may be able from the code, this system is not built to be scaled.\\r\\n2. Populate `.env` file with bot token, whitelist, any API keys (openai, anthropic, ...), and more. See [.example.env](.example.env).\\r\\n3. Run directly with `python bot.py`, create a systemd service or a docker container, whatever. Recommended option for deployment on linux is a systemd service that runs as a non-root user.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy default, the bot will spawn Codex CLI in a docker container. You can disable this and have it be spawned directly as a normal process by setting `NO_DOCKER=1` in your `.env` file.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Requirements\\r\\n\\r\\n- python (required) >= 3.9\\r\\n- node.js (required) >= 22\\r\\n- docker (recommended) >= 21: If you want to run Codex in a docker container to minimize potential damage.
